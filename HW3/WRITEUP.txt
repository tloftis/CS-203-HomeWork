The Time it takes to get the list of words from the file is m, where m = number of words in file
The Time it takes to sort the contents of each individual word uses quicksort who's average run time is nLog(n) where n = number of elemens to sort

From this we get the time m*n*Log(n).

Now, using some resources from Wolfram alpha we get the average length of English words is 5.1

using this we can replace the value n with 5 bring the time to m*5.1log(5.1) ~ 3.69

The longest word in the English dictionary is 45 characters long, pneumonoultramicroscopicsilicovolcanoconiosis

bringing the maximum value for the sort time to 45*Log(45) ~ 74.39

There are near 600,00 words in the English language, so in worse case m = 600000
Source: http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=how+many+english+words+are+there

Bringing the average word case with the whole of the English dictionary you get 600000*5.1*Log(5.1) ~ 2165164.74

Now, if we want to get very crazy with the run time, the absolute worse case for quicksort is n^2, this would make the new time 600000*5.1^2 = 15,606,000

So, not that bad really.
